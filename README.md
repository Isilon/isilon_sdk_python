# Python Language Bindings

This repository is part of the Isilon SDK, which is an evolving package of
documents and files. This README describes how to install and configure Python
language bindings in order to access the OneFS API on an Isilon cluster from a
Python script. You can use the OneFS API to automate the configuration,
maintenance, and monitoring of your Isilon cluster.

* For OneFS API reference documents, discussions, and blog posts, refer to the
[OneFS SDK Info Hub](https://community.emc.com/docs/DOC-48273).

[Stat Key Browser](https://github.com/isilon/isilon_stat_browser.git)
GitHub repository.
